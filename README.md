- 👋 Hi, I’m @hicelery
- 👀 I’m interested in embedded software, web development, data manipulation and trying to deploy these into tangible projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development with react and node.js looking to expand my knowledge of back-end tools
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on LYEBOARDS! I have an eye for design and enjoy tweaking, making and creating with the end-user in mind
